# Multilevel-Biometric-Authentication

The article below explores on building a multilevel authentication service using biometrics which stores the user data and manages sessions on the cloud. The objective is to authenticate the user using his/her biometrics, the face and the voice specifically as they are unique for every user. Some downsides to this approach are that biometric data can still be leaked from the database and these features can be replicated too in some cases. Thus, in order to make the authentication stronger, in this article we are proposing a multilevel approach consisting of facial and voice recognition simultaneously to reduce the chances of mimicking and also enhance the security of the biometric data stored in the database by saving the biometrics as a hash.
